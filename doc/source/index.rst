Motivation
----------

This project aims to provide a minimal and standalone Open Source IoT platform.The focus is on systems with a deployment of up to a few thousand devices, it does not aim to be scalable to millions of devices. The goal is to build a system that recieves e.g. regular temperature samples from remote IoT devices. The temperature samples will be send to a backend and stored in a database. The data is be visualized in a web application.

Vision
